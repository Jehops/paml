README.txt for PAML

PAML (for Phylogentic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood) contains a few
programs for model fitting and phylogenetic tree reconstruction using
nucleotide or amino-acid sequence data.  ANSI C source codes as well
as Win32 and PowerMac excutables are distributed.  A Makefile is
provided for UNIX machines; type make to compile.  

Two html files provide the documentation for paml: paml.html (the paml
web page) and pamlDOC.pdf.  The program can be downloaded from the paml 
web page at

	http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html

PAML is distributed free of charge for academic use only.  Comments
and suggestions are appreciated.
