This folder contains the control file, the sequence data file and the
tree file for demonstrating codon models that use different dN/dS
ratios among lineages (Yang 1998).  The included data set is the
"small" data set analyzed in Yang (1998).  The default control file
let you duplicate the results for the small data set in table 1 of
Yang (1998).  Also look at the tree file about specifying the branches
of interest, for which positive selection is tested.

Usage:

	codeml lysozyme.ctl

Or you can rename the file lysozyme.ctl as codeml.ctl, and then run 

         codeml
