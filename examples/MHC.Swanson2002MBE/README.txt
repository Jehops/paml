This is the MHC dataset analyzed by Yang & Swanson (2002).  Note that
this paper implemented models M1 and M2 instead of M1a and M2a.  The
modified models were introduced in 2004 (paml 3.14), so if you run the
current version of paml/codeml, the results for M1a and M2a will be
different from those listed in the paper.  The M7 and M8 results
should be the same.

The lysin dataset analyzed in Yang and Swanson (2002) is also included
in the package, in the examples/lysin/ folder.

This mhc dataset is also used to produce the results of table 8.3, and
figures 8.4 and 9.5 in Yang (2006).  The default codeml.ctl file runs
models M0, M1a, and M2a.
