This folder contains the control file, sequence data file and the tree
file for models of variable dN/dS rate ratios among sites (the NSsites
models).

 
You run the NSsites analysis by typing

    codemlsites HIVenvSweden.ctl 

and then selecting the models you want for the batch run.  

Or if you use codeml, the control file right now fits the one-ratio
model, and you change the variable NSsites and perhaps ncatG as well
to run other models.  The data set was used in the Nielsen and Yang
(1998) paper.
